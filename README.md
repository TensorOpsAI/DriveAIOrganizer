# Google Drive Organizer

This Python script is designed to help you efficiently organize files in your Google Drive, including both your personal drive and shared company drives. It uses the Google Drive API to list and manage files and folders and integrates with the OpenAI API to provide intelligent suggestions for optimal file organization.

## Features

- **Google Drive Integration**: Access and list files from your personal Google Drive and any shared drives you have access to.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Utilize OpenAI's GPT model to classify files and suggest appropriate folder placements or indicate when no move is needed.
- **Comprehensive Folder Retrieval**: Fetch and display the folder structure within shared drives.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates using the `tqdm` library.
- **CSV Export**: Save the classification results to a CSV file in your Google Drive.
